I found a home in making websites and soon after opened up my world of programming to other languages like React, React Native and Python. I want to use my github to build "cool things"(more subjectively cool than objectively haha) and prgrams of value and use. It won't be rare to catch me putting a fun twist on a traditional project like making a Nene Leakes Twist on making another Twitter!
